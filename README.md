# Li-P-S-data
This repository contains the data for the work titled "Atomic-level Insights into the Highly Conductive Lithium Thiophosphate Solid Electrolytes with Exceptional Stability Against Lithium Metal".

The data is composed of:
1) Relaxed bulk structures,
2) Relaxed surfaces with minimum surface formation energies
3) Relaxed interfaces between lithium thiophosphates electrolyte and Li-metal anode (Li-P-S//Li)
